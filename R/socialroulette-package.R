#' socialroulette: A package to generate social groupings
#'
#' A package for partitioning individuals into groups of a pre-specified size. This can be as simple as using simple random sampling (srs)
#' to divide n individuals into groups of size at least m. If one keeps track of the past partitions then an additional
#' aim can be to try to maximize the time that people have a reunion, i.e. end up in the same group. This boils
#' down to an instance of the maximally diverse grouping problem.
#' See the [package website](https://hoehleatsu.github.io/socialroulette/)  for more information, documentation and examples.
#'
#' A side effect of the package is that it provides a maximally diverse grouping problem solver, which
#' can -in principle- be used for other purposed. As a consequence, functionality which could be considered as
#' internal, can be helpful.
